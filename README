Guide to git
============

A couple of years ago there was a battle over what was going to be the
version control software of the future; in 2013 it seems safe to say
that git has won.

However, git did NOT win because of user-friendliness. Hence this
guide. (It won because it can do many, many more things than the
others and has a really strong technical foundation).

The thing to understand is that Subversion provides *both* a tool
and an enforced workflow. Git provides lower-level tools and you
need to use those to set up your own workflow.

For *anything* more complicated than editing a paper one *must*
understand how git works; attempting to follow recipes will
cause dizzyness and confusion when things don't work. Here's
an explanation:

Or come ask me.

However, for something as simple as editing a paper, let's try
a recipe.

1)

    $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com


2) Since you're reading this, you already have a GitHub account.
   For write access GitHub needs your SSH public key, so go to
   https://github.com/settings/ssh and upload
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub).

3)

    $ git clone git@github.com:dagss/paper-commander2-wmap9yr.git
    $ cd paper-commander2-wmap9yr

4) Before starting to edit paper (and unless you just cloned), pull
   any changes others might have done:

    $ git pull --rebase

5) Edit paper. When done, make a local commit:

    $ git commit -am 'Polished abstract'

6) Attempt to push. If this succeeds, nobody else made a commit in the meantime,
   and you are done:

    $ git push

7) If that failed, you need to first pull other people's commits; your
   own commits will be "stacked on top". If that doesn't work, see 8).
   Otherwise attempt to push again:

    $ git pull --rebase
    $ git push

8) The "pull --rebase" command can fail if there's a conflict you need
   to resolve.  In that case go and do so (in the tex-file).  After
   that you do:

    $ git add commander2-wmap9yr.tex
    $ git rebase --continue
    $ git push

   Yes, "add" doesn't mean what you expect it to.
